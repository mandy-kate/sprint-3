 What is you site's primary purpose?
 To put into practice what I am learning at EDA about HTML, CSS, responsive design etc.
 Who is your target audience?
 Audience will be people in my cohort, teachers at EDA, friends and family. Also audience is myself - as I will be looking back over my blog entries as I progress through the course to remind myself what key principles I have learnt along the way.
 How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have? Visually appealing, so regardless of which device they are on the content fits well on the screen.
 How will you build your site to support your desired user experience? Using skeleton framework as a starting point. Adding on addtional responsive design elements using media queries as required.
